If you press the button "Clear grid", it erases all and create a new grid with customize square size. "Eraser" button erases all the content already painted. "Random" does the same as the "Black" button, but instead of filling squares with black, it fills it with a random color. Lastly, "Add borders" just adds borders to all the little squares into the container.
